# ParSeq

ParSeq is a framework that makes it easier to write asynchronous code in Java.

Some of the key benefits of ParSeq include:

* Parallelization of asynchronous operations (such as IO)
* Serialized execution for non-blocking computation
* Code reuse via task composition
* Simple error propagation and recovery
* Execution tracing and visualization
